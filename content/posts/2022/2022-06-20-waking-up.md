## The Book in 3 Sentences

1. Consciousness is the only undoubtedly real thing in the universe, and one’s relationship with its contents (thoughts, sights, emotions) determines the quality of their experience.
2. Religion is a flawed and acutely dangerous path to spirituality that must be replaced by a more experiential, rational approach to contemplation.
3. Constant identification with the contents of consciousness, namely thoughts, shapes the illusion of the self that is responsible for much of human suffering.

## How I Discovered It

I’ve listened to several podcasts that Sam Harris has appeared in where he has mentioned this book. He frequently quotes passages in the Waking Up app too.

## How the Book Changed Me

Through Sam Harris’ works have I finally arrived at a point where meditation seems to be blending in with my usual experience. The feeling of total presence in the moment is not confined to the ten minutes I spend with my airpods plugged in at dawn. Instead, I have been unlocking momentary states of true insight into the contents of my experience, detaching from the patterns of thought that otherwise have left me distracted. Still, I struggle to retract into being an observer of thoughts when I most need it, particularly when I’m having conversations. That is when my anxious mind takes over.

## Top Quotes

> Ceaseless change is an unreliable basis for lasting fulfillment.

> The fact that the universe is illuminated where you stand — that your thoughts and moods and sensations have a qualitative character in this moment — is a mystery, exceeded only by the mystery that there should be something rather than nothing in the first place

> What you are calling “I” is itself a feeling that arises among the contents of consciousness. Consciousness is prior to it, a mere witness of it, and, therefore, free of it in principle

> meditation is simply the ability to stop suffering in many of the usual ways, if only for a few moments at a time

> Consciousness is the prior condition of every experience; the self or ego is an illusory appearance within it; look closely for what you are calling “I,” and the feeling of being a separate self will disappear; what remains, as a matter of experience, is a field of consciousness — free, undivided, and intrinsically uncontaminated by its ever-changing contents.

## Notes

### Spirituality

- The mind is all we have with us in each moment and thus determines the quality of experience
- Religious dogmas are not prerequisites to states of exceptional love, fulfillment, an insight; they are an archaic and dangerous path devoid of empirical truth
- Buddhism without its myths is a science of experience (Vipassana)
- No self at the center of consciousness
- Noticing and ceasing to identify with patterns of thought is the surest way to freedom in the present
- Meditation is the source of the most durable form of satisfaction

### Consciousness

- Experience is the precusor to any and all interactions and contemplations
- Emerges from physical interactions but cannot be reduced to it; introspection is the best way to seek to understand consciousness
- Brain is split into two hemispheres and thus consciousness itself is divisible
    - Experiments done on patients with a severed corpus callosum demonstrate conflicting behaviors explained by the independent roles of each hemisphere
- The unconscious influences thoughts, feelings, and actions yet consciousness is the only lever to the quality of experience

### Self

- There is no seat of consciousness - an illusion that disappears upon close attention
- No neurological basis for a unified self that is in control; we are the products of a set of discrete unconscious structures and processes
- Sense of self emerges from experience but consciousness is free from it
- Theory of Mind - perceptions of others’ mental states and of our existence in their experience contributes to the feeling of self

### Meditation

- Brings to light a form of well-being inherent to consciousness
- Noticing thoughts as transitory appearances in consciousness
- Complete acceptance of the present
- Insights can be had at any point in practice and may last for moments
- Dzogchen - Tibetan practice emphasizing the selflessness of awareness and the lack of a subject-object dualism
- Douglas Harding’s _On Having No Head_ offers a glimpse into the non-duality of consciousness

### Gurus and Substances

- Near Death Experiences (NDA) can only be confirmed if no brain activity is present
    - Thinking independent of the brain would also prove mind-body dualism
- DMT is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter with a psychedelic effect of the least time
- Psychedelics impact the serotonin pathway, and not dopamine which is why they’re not addictive
- Psychedelics demonstrate the brain’s potential, pushing the subject to a realization of the full extent of consciousness
- Nevertheless, practices in ordinary waking states of consciousness are still sufficient to attain lasting states of fulfillment and insight
