## What It's About

It is as much a work of fantasy and science-fiction as it is a coming-of-age novel. The protagonist, Paul, is introduced as an unsuspecting heir to the Duke of a planet but over the course of the novel, he assumes the role of a leader, prophet, military general, and father. The novel is largely a commentary on power, politics, and greed - all stemming from an intense covet for the melange spice of Dune. Enriching its world-building, _Dune_ also delves into the ecology of Arrakis with vivid images of the monstrous sandworms and the stillsuits designed by the Fremen to retain the limited moisture of the planet.

The Atreides family is forced to move from the lush planet of Caladan, birthplace of Paul, to the dry stranded deserts of Arrakis. They settle into an air of paranoia which culminates in the death of Duke Leto after being betrayed by Doctor Yueh. The Harkonnens take over the planet, and Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica are forced to seek shelter among the desert-dwelling Fremen. The rest of the novel follows Paul's journey in uncovering his potential as the Kwisatz Haderach, a special child born out of generations of a genetic experiment, and using his capabilities to organize the Fremen and take back the planet from Baron Vladmir and the Harkonnens.

## How I Discovered It

I was initially drawn to this book by the trailer to the upcoming movie featuring Jason Momoa and Zendaya. Afterwards, the book seemed to everywhere on Reddit and Amazon, so I decided to be part of that hype.

## A Critical Look

> _Don't waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore_

This book continued to remind me of the contrast between power over and power within. That contrast is quite evident between the ruling philosophies of Duke Leto and the Baron. One rules with trust and respect from his subjects, while the other seeks power through their suppression. Of course, this parallels Brene Brown's discussion of Trump presidency in contrast to the values Biden appears to voice thus far. Will the next four bring a change in the general sentiment surrounding American politics?

> _A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both._

> _How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him._

Recently, I have really been struggling with controlling myself in moments of rage, losing semblance of the goals I set and the kind of person I strive to be. In those moments, I tend to be destructive. I damage things, make hurtful comments, and embarrass myself - in front of myself. Despite experiencing a tragic betrayal and learning about the death of his father, Paul is able to maintain his calm and plan for the long term. Part of it is his denial but he is still able to form a coalition of the Fremen to eventually take down the Baron.

> _having experienced and possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss_

As a genetic anomaly, Paul possesses extraordinary abilities that allow him compute multitudes of possible futures, forming the 'prescience' that is constantly brought up. Even then, he suffers momentary lapses of confusion, situations where he must improvise. Similarly, I find myself consuming this profusion of information - valuable or not - every single day through the news, books, social media etc, yet I find myself lost in the circumstances that most require applications of that knowledge. For that reason, I have taken on note-taking through this platform and journal through Daylio. I think I won't realize my ability to apply that knowledge unless I put myself in situations that warrant such applications.

> _The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever._

I am a fervent adherent to the bodybuilder's creed of progressive overload. Lifting heavier, performing more reps, and increasing tension on the muscles is what ultimately leads to hypertrophy and overall progress. This mentality also bleeds into other parts of life. Challenging oneself constantly is how growth occurs and is a crucial part of maturity. This quote doesn't play into the key messages of the book but it's simply powerful. Taking it easy is indeed a sign of ignorance. One who continually challenges their abilities and attitude is en route to a more enlightened existence. No argument there.

## What I did and didn't like

The sophistication of the novel is its most appealing feature to me. The interplay of politics, economics, ecology, and human greed is simply fascinating. If it weren't for the vast terminology and lore, I would love to take a critical look at the societal structure of this world.

First off, the book was just tedious to get through. It felt like a drag in numerous areas, and the unexplained terms that filled up each line didn't exactly help either. Although the plot, in hindsight, was quite compelling, my struggles with comprehension took away from the suspense and awe that it would otherwise have ensued.
