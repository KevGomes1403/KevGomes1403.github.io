## **_From Books_**

I powered through _When Breath Becomes Air_, a book that was as profound as I expected. It wasn't so much Paul's monologs on death but rather in finding meaning in his work as well as the relationships he fosters along the way. It is ultimately people he serves: his wife and parents at home, and comforting his patients and their families at work. It's also the disturbing attitudes of anatomy students who don't quite comprehend that they are working with real dead people that stands out.

It's \[The Alchemist\] essentially about finding one's calling and taking whatever risks necessary to pursue it. The beginning stages will be easy but one must face the intermission and climax with a tremendous amount of courage and perseverance. The journey is what ultimately matters - the people you meet, the sacrifices you make, the perspectives you gain and also lose etc etc. Another major theme is change. Like the lead that turns into gold, people have the ability to morph, evolve, and upgrade themselves. The pursuit of their calling is fundamental to achieving that growth. Being motivated to change for intrinsic and relational reasons is what love is. The protagonist whose name already evades me, is always on the journey for the sake of love. At first it was his love for adventure and his flock, then it was the promise of reuniting with Fatima. When one loves, they realize that it's not a feeling of possession but of trust, which involves letting loose sometimes.

Where we focus our attention and concentration is where we derive our personality from. Being able to concentrate on activities that support our values and self is ultimately what leads to flow and personal growth.

Steve Jobs was obsessive, sometimes revolting, and often insufferable but he was  
a visionary. He was confident and self-assured which I thoroughly respect even if it verges on  
narcissism.

## **_From Podcasts_**

From Jordan peterson I further learned the value of collaboration. His argument being that humans are I coined to reciprocate as that has proved to be the optimal strategy even in the face of fierce sexual and political rivalry.

Dude \[Jose Zuniga\] calls himself a masochist in that he loved work, the discomfort of managing the businesses and teams he has built, and maintaining his fruitful marriage, for which I consider him to truly fit into the stoic realm. Moreover his motto surrounds the idea that any man however ugly can make leaps in their presentation simply through conscious action. Putting the blame on race or birth is all bs because it is all up to the self. His work ethic and commitment to self improvement is simply amazing and something I genuinely want to model my life on.

## **_Some Clarity_**

I'm ultimately working in tech, cs, electrical engineering or whatever to serve people. That is the purpose. The stoics believe that the common good serves the individual so long as they are part of that community. By pursuing that future I'm contributing to society regardless of the trivialities that may arise, including my recent job. I find it tedious and monotonous but I'm bringing joy to families as they eat, ease the conscience of the anxious general managers perhaps, and reduce the likelihood of unpaid debt in the future.
