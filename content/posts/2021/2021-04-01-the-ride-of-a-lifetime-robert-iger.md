## How I Discovered It

I believe it was one of Ali Abdaal's book videos that provided a brief introduction to this particular book. Seeing that it was readily available on Libby, I immediately picked it up. The fact that it's about Disney was also quite appealing.

## How the Book Changed Me

This book has given me more clarity regarding Disney's role in modern media and has drawn a distinction from big tech corporations. In fact, I might just have a newfound respect for them as a brand and a company. Learning about their artistic vision has motivated me to actually pick up Disney Plus and catch myself up on Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, Iger's ideals of decency and integrity seem to contradict the broader message about power in 48 laws, so I'm also more contemplative regarding leadership.

### Disney's Journey

Robert Iger had 3 general tenets in turning around the company when he took over. Everything they did right generally falls into this roadmap.

**_Creating high quality branded content ._** The acquisition of ABC already brought live sports, news, and popular shows into Disney's collection. In addition, Pixar and the talent that came with it helped revive animation. Marvel brought with a plethora of creative potential which turned into the MCU. Lucasfilms added the Star Wars trilogy and its fans, and a massive potential for expansion.

**_Embracing technology._** This began when Iger sealed a deal with Jobs to house Disney's content on the iTunes store that would ship on Apple's new video iPods. Finally, they embraced the shift away from traditional cable to streaming platforms through Disney Plus. They will suffer losses for the platform's first few years as the transition occurs, but it will pay off over the long term. And it displays courage.

**_Becoming a truly global company._** The Fox acquisition provided access to major audiences around the globe, including India's primary streaming service Hotstar. This expanded their direct-to-consumer business in key thriving markets throughout the world. Moreover, the completion of Shanghai's Disneyland expanded their reach in the world's most populous country.

This chart from Brene Brown's interview with Biden on her podcast _Unlocking Us_ perfectly categorizes Robert Iger's ideologies that guided his tenure as Disney's CEO. It stands in stark contrast to the ideas outlined in Robert Greene's _The 48 Laws of Power_. Iger operates on mutual respect and transparency, rather than viewing his position through an aggressive lens like someone holding 'Power Over' would.
