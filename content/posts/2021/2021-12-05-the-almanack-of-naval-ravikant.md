## The Book in 3 Sentences

1. Society objectively reflects back the value that you provide it, and also the attitude with which you thrive in it.
2. Value independence above all else - independence from your internal monologue, the burdens of desire, the constraints of lacking leverage.
3. Being firm on the basics is far more important than having a surface-level knowledge of advanced topics; read the classics before any contemporary take.

## How the Book Changed Me

I have become far more conscientious during my morning meditation, using some of the quotes from this book as prompts to notice when my mind wanders. I have also re-calibrated my current conception of a career path to value independence and accrue leverage through skills that would allow me to subsist beyond the confines of a company. Being a creator of sorts has been a distant goal for the past few months but now I'm more specific on what I need to aim for. The idea of starting a company feels within reach now. Valuing honesty, clarifying my values, being focused on my goals, and prioritizing action. Lastly, my ability to accept what's not within my control has improved through Naval's framing of the matter.
