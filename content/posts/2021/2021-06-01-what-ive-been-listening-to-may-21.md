[Stats for Spotify](http://statsforspotify.com) is my primary tool for tracking my listening habits.

Punk and hip hop really pumps my sets at the gym which my recent statistics reflect. Also, Machine Gun Kelly is simply bomb. Although his recent releases with Travis Barker are on a whole new level, his previous albums still hold up as quality rap.

I like how Eminem is his own genre.
