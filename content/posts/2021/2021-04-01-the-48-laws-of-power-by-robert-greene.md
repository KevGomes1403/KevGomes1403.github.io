## Summary + Notes

#### Law 2: Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies

A friend grows envious while a forgiven enemy has more to prove.

> _Pick up a bee from kindness, and learn the limitations of kindness_

#### Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions

Seem inconspicuous and attract little attention as you carry out your designs. The outcome will speak scores for your adversaries.

> _Conceal your purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your designs until they cannot be opposed -_ Ninon de Lenclos

#### Law 4: Always Say Less Than Necessary

> _the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control_

#### Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor

Occasionally withdrawing oneself creates scarcity, reminding others of their value. The looming risk of losing one will force respect from everyone else.

> _The longer the days of rain, the more the sun is craved. But too many hot days and the sun overwhelms._

#### Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness

Play the game of appearances by exhibiting boldness. It creates fear, draws attention, and hides underlying deficiencies. Hesitancy leaves one vulnerable and likely to fade into the crowd.

> _Fear of failure in the mind of a performer is, for an onlooker, already evidence of failure_
> 
> Baltasar Gracian

#### Law 30: Make Your Accomplishments Seem Effortless

Sublime actions attract more respect than those known to be the result of toil. One must create an aura of mystery regarding the source and extent of their capabilities.

> _guesses and doubts about the extent of his talents arouse more veneration than accurate knowledge of them_
> 
> Baltasar Gracian

#### Law 36: Disdain Things You Cannot Have

Ignore what is petty and prioritize the formidable. One's standards are reflected in the rigor of the challenges they endure.

> _By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility_

#### Law 48: Assume Formlessness

Appear unpredictable and adapt to the enemy's advances. Creativity, deliberation, and flexibility will move initiative to one's side and leave the enemy confused, eventually revealing their intentions.

> _When one has but one point to defend, it should be protected for fear of accident_
> 
> Jean De La Fontaine
