## What It's About

It's New York in 1985 during the height of tensions concerning a potential nuclear fallout against Russia during the Cold War. Formerly known as the Comedian, Edward Blake has largely retired after the passage of the Keene Act which banned masked vigilantes. One day, he is thrown off a building, prompting Rorschach, a nihilist member of the Watchmen, to investigate this alleged mask-killer. During his quest, Rorschach is arrested after being framed for the murder of the retired villain to the Watchmen named Moloch. Dr. Manhattan leaves to Mars after being burdened by allegations of causing cancer and more so because of his breakup with Laurie Jupiter, the Silk Specter. Somewhat convinced of Rorschach's concerns, Laurie and Dan Dreiberg (Nite Owl) eventually break him out of prison. Thereafter, Dan and Rorschach uncover Adrian Veidt's (aka Ozymandias) role in the events that unfolded thus far and travel to Antarctica to confront him. After a failed attempt to neutralize Veidt, the two of them learn that he has unleashed a false alien invasion in New York, wiping out half the city. After a depressing conversation with Manhattan, Laurie returns with him to New York to find a city drenched in corpses and blood.

The event traumatizes the world into peace, bringing an end to the rising Cold War tension by forming a global alliance. A still distressed Rorschach attempts to leave for New York until Dr Manhattan vaporizes him in order to preserve their secret. Veidt and the remaining Watchmen live on in a world built on false peace.

## How I Discovered It

Well, my first exposure to this work was in Ms Fletcher's classroom sometime last in the past year or year-and-a-half where the distinct image of New Yorkers hanging off that clock really stuck with me. Delving into the world of graphic novels had also left me convinced that this book really is worthy of being in an AP English classroom. With all that hype, I just couldn't help but dive deeper into graphic novels through this as a catalyst.

## Thoughts

Rorschach and Dr Manhattan - two characters unified by their nihilism towards human civilization yet different in their apparent responses to reality. Rorschach actively aims to eliminate the darkness while Manhattan, whom I absolutely despise, regards the world with indifference.

> _This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces forces. It is not God who kills the children, not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It's Us. Only Us. -_ Rorschach

He is quite right in that the issues plaguing the world have no external origin. Everything leads back to human action. People tend to project their negative sentiments on external factors, rid themselves of any culpability, disillusion themselves with a lack of control over their circumstances. As such, I empathize with his actions throughout the book. He treats the madness preeminent in New York with even more insanity, only to be ridiculed and frowned on by those sitting on a false pedestal of purity. He is the only Watchmen with conviction that change is possible and acts on it with full faith.

> _We gaze continually at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another's vantage point, as if new, it may still take the breath away. -_ Dr. Manhattan

All throughout, I hated his character for being rather childish. He displays an utter lack of empathy towards Laurie and the events of the world as he leaves to Mars after being dumped by her. He sees the future yet remains remains a puppet to the flow of time, seemingly by choice - it's something that I really don't understand. In spite of possessing Godlike powers that can be used without any personal consequences, he refuses to stand by Laurie. His adamant attitude is ultimately what allows Veidt to carry out his plan. Once he does come to his enlightenment that order and civilization does possess an inherent beauty, it feels superficial. It happens in a jiffy with no real weight to that realization. What really frustrates me is when he finally murders Rorschach.

The final sequence of events play into the novel's recurring question: "Who watches the Watchmen?" which I learned yesterday is derived from ancient Rome. Masked vigilantes in this world carry out their activities in a reckless manner, compelling the passage of the Keene Act. Even Mason Hollis and Dan Dreiberg admit that they were largely motivated by the thrill of putting on a costume and combating crime, paying no heed to the repercussions or sentiments of the public. Ultimately, they do unify the Red and the Blue, the right-wing and left-wing, and pull the world away from the edge of nuclear fallout. But who are they to make these decisions for society?
