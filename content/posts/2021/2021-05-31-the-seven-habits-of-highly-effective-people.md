# The Book in 3 Sentences

1. Deep personal change occurs from the fundamental paradigms and principles from which attitudes and behaviors stem.
2. There must be a balance in producing results and maintaining that ability to keep producing (P/PC balance)
3. Growth is a function of mastering oneself and applying that internal stability to have a positive effect in the lives of others.

# How the Book Changed Me

How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.

Books as such are definitely pushing me away from the type of attitude that Robert Greene vouches for in his book, making me think more in 'Win/Win' terms as Covey would put it. With all the guided meditation I've been doing, I've been learning more to control my responses to circumstances, better realizing that I can only control what I do. To be completely honest, I can't speak for the results this early into the process, but I can say for sure that it's getting further ingrained into my brain. When the circumstances require it, I remember the concepts of Quadrant II activities, Emotional Bank Account, paradigms etc more often. Also, whenever I feel left out or down or unmotivated, I remember that I'm working on the principles that my being is centered on. I'm not hinged on external circumstances like friends anymore.

It comes from striking at the root—the fabric of our thought, the fundamental, essential paradigms, which give definition to our character and create the lens through which we see the world._
